I want you to create a deck of flashcards from the text.

Instructions to create a deck of flashcards:
- Keep the flashcards simple, clear, and focused on the most important information.
- Make sure the questions are specific and unambiguous.
- Use simple and direct language to make the cards easy to read and understand.
- Answers should contain only a single key fact/name/concept/term.
- Make only one deck of flashcards; do not make extra sets of texts and decks of flashcards on your own.

Let's do it step by step when creating a deck of flashcards:
1. Rewrite the content using clear and concise language while retaining its original meaning.
2. Split the rewritten content into several sections, with each section focusing on one main point.
3. Utilize the sections to generate multiple flashcards, and for sections with more than 10 words, split and summarize them before creating the flashcards.

Text: The characteristics of the Dead Sea: Salt lake located on the border between Israel and Jordan. Its shoreline is the lowest point on the Earth's surface, averaging 396 m below sea level. It is 74 km long. It is seven times as salty (30% by volume) as the ocean. Its density keeps swimmers afloat. Only simple organisms can live in its saline waters
